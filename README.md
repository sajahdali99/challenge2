# Challenge2
- What was the challenge?
The challenge was to run containers after building images inside them and link the containers using a network that we would have to create.
- How I expected the challenge to go.
Given that we just learned about networks, containers and how to use docker commands I was feeling pretty confident about the task, given that much of the infomation was fresh in the memory.
- What went well?
I felt compotent in my usage and understanding of docker commands during the challenge.
- What didn't go as planned?
Creating more than one container and linking them proved more difficult than imagined as I grew increasingly confused on the matter, however I managed to overcome these issues by communicating my problems with my peers.
- Possible improvements for future challenges.
I would focus on tasks I find the easiest to complete first in order to save time furthermore I must always refer back to my notes.
